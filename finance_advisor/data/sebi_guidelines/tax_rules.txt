Equity Mutual Funds are taxed according to the duration for which units are held. Short-Term Capital Gains (STCG) apply if the units are held for less than one year. The gains under STCG are taxed at a flat rate of 15 percent regardless of the investor’s income slab. Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) apply if units are held for more than one year. LTCG is taxed at 10 percent for gains exceeding ₹1 lakh in a financial year. Security Transaction Tax (STT) is applicable on the sale of units, which is already included in the gain computation. For example, if an investor redeems units after 14 months and the gain is ₹1.5 lakh, only ₹50,000 is taxable at 10 percent LTCG.
Debt Mutual Funds are taxed based on the investor’s income tax slab, as they are treated as fixed-income instruments. Short-Term Capital Gains (STCG) are applicable for units held for less than three years, and these gains are added to the investor’s total income for the financial year and taxed according to the applicable slab rate. Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) are applicable if units are held for more than three years. Indexation benefits allow investors to adjust the purchase price for inflation, thereby reducing taxable gains. However, for investments made after 1 April 2023, indexation benefits have been removed for debt mutual funds, and gains are taxed based on the slab rates. Debt funds include ultra-short-term, short-term, medium-term, long-term, corporate bonds, gilt funds, and credit risk funds.
Hybrid Funds’ taxation depends on the allocation between equity and debt. If the equity allocation is 65 percent or more, the fund is treated as an equity fund, and STCG and LTCG rules for equity apply. If equity allocation is less than 65 percent, the fund is treated as a debt fund, and taxation follows debt rules. For example, a hybrid fund with 70 percent equity and 30 percent debt is taxed like an equity fund; whereas a hybrid fund with 60 percent equity is taxed like a debt fund. Investors need to check the fund’s equity percentage at the time of investment for correct taxation.
Equity Linked Savings Schemes (ELSS) are specialized mutual funds that qualify for tax deductions under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, up to ₹1,50,000 per financial year. ELSS has a mandatory 3-year lock-in period, and all units redeemed within three years cannot be sold. Gains from ELSS are treated as equity for tax purposes, meaning LTCG at 10 percent applies for gains above ₹1 lakh. This makes ELSS a combination of tax saving and wealth creation for long-term investors.
Dividends received from mutual funds are added to the investor’s taxable income. Prior to 1 April 2020, funds used to pay Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT) before distributing dividends to investors, but the current rules tax dividends directly in the hands of investors at their applicable slab rate. Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) are subject to TDS at 10 percent on dividends from equity funds, while residents pay according to their income tax slab. Dividends from debt funds are also added to taxable income and taxed as per slab rates. Investors should keep track of dividend payouts across all mutual fund investments to correctly report them in their tax returns.
Arbitrage Funds, although generally low-risk, are taxed as equity funds due to their minimum 65 percent equity exposure. This makes them attractive for investors seeking low-risk equity taxation benefits. STCG of 15 percent applies if units are held for less than one year, and LTCG of 10 percent above ₹1 lakh applies for longer holdings. For example, an arbitrage fund redeeming units after eight months will have STCG taxed at 15 percent, while units held for 14 months will be subject to LTCG rules.
Index Funds and ETFs track a specific market index, such as NIFTY 50, NIFTY Next 50, or NIFTY Midcap 150. Equity-oriented ETFs are taxed as equity funds, while debt ETFs and gold ETFs follow debt taxation rules. International ETFs, or funds investing in foreign securities, are typically treated as debt for taxation purposes because they do not meet the SEBI domestic equity requirements. Investors need to consider currency fluctuations, as gains may also be influenced by exchange rate movements.
Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) are treated unit-wise for taxation. Each installment is considered a separate purchase, and the holding period for capital gains is calculated individually for each unit. For instance, if an investor invests ₹5,000 per month for 12 months, each ₹5,000 investment will have its own STCG or LTCG calculation depending on the holding period. This is important for long-term tax planning, as SIP gains may be partially short-term and partially long-term.
Systematic Withdrawal Plans (SWPs) are also subject to taxation. When units are sold under SWP, capital gains are computed based on the cost of units sold. Equity fund SWPs are taxed according to STCG and LTCG rules, while debt fund SWPs are taxed according to the investor’s slab rate with indexation benefits applicable for units held longer than three years. This affects the net returns for investors using SWPs as a regular income source.
Switching between mutual fund schemes, even within the same fund house, is considered a redemption of the existing scheme and a fresh purchase of the new scheme. This is a taxable event, and capital gains tax applies based on the holding period of the units sold. For example, switching from a large-cap fund to a mid-cap fund will attract capital gains tax as if the units were redeemed, even if no cash leaves the account.
NRIs are subject to Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on redemption proceeds. For equity funds, TDS on STCG is 15 percent, while LTCG above ₹1 lakh is 10 percent. Debt funds for NRIs may attract TDS up to 30 percent depending on the type of security. These taxes are deducted automatically at the time of redemption by the fund house.
Gifting mutual fund units is allowed and is generally tax-free for the recipient. However, when the recipient redeems the units, capital gains tax applies based on the original purchase price and holding period. This allows families to transfer wealth without immediate tax implications, but gains are eventually taxable.
Unit-linked insurance plans (ULIPs) with premiums exceeding ₹2.5 lakh per year are taxed like mutual funds. Gains are subject to equity or debt taxation rules depending on the underlying asset allocation. This ensures that high-premium policies are treated consistently with mutual fund taxation.
International equity funds investing in global or foreign ETFs are taxed as debt funds under Indian law since they do not meet the domestic equity definition. Gains from these funds are added to the investor’s income and taxed according to the applicable slab rates. Currency gains or losses from foreign investments are included in taxable income.
Gold ETFs and Fund of Funds (FoFs) investing in gold or commodity schemes are treated as debt funds for taxation purposes. Gains from units held for less than three years are taxed as short-term capital gains according to the slab rate, while units held for more than three years qualify for long-term capital gains with indexation benefits if purchased before the 2023 rule change. Post-2023 units follow slab rates without indexation.
Capital losses from mutual funds can be offset against gains from funds of the same category and carried forward for eight assessment years. Losses from equity funds can be set off against equity gains, while losses from debt funds are set off against debt fund gains. This allows investors to optimize tax planning across multiple fund investments.
Frequent trading of mutual fund units can be considered a business activity by the Income Tax Department. In such cases, profits are treated as business income and losses cannot be carried forward as capital losses. Investors maintaining long-term investment behavior avoid this classification.
Overall, mutual fund taxation depends on multiple factors including fund type (equity, debt, hybrid, ELSS, arbitrage), holding period, investor type (resident or NRI), the nature of income (capital gains, dividends), and applicable exemptions. Understanding these rules is critical to maximize net returns and ensure compliance. Proper tax planning can help investors align their mutual fund investments with financial goals while minimizing tax liability.
