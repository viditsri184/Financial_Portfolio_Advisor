SEBI has defined a Risk-O-Meter with 6 mandatory risk levels for all mutual funds. Each mutual fund must display its risk level monthly.

1) Low Risk:
Funds with minimal volatility such as Overnight Funds and Liquid Funds. Suitable for extremely conservative investors, short-term parking, and emergency funds. Risk arises mainly from interest rate fluctuations.

2) Low to Moderate Risk:
Funds with slightly higher maturity or limited credit exposure. Includes Ultra Short Duration, Short Duration, and Conservative Hybrid Funds. Suitable for investors seeking stability with some return enhancement.

3) Moderate Risk:
Includes Corporate Bond Funds, Banking & PSU Funds, Medium Duration Debt Funds, and Balanced Hybrid Funds. Suitable for 2–4 year horizons. Moderate interest rate and credit risk.

4) Moderately High Risk:
Includes Flexi Cap Funds, Multi Cap Funds, Balanced Advantage Funds, and Multi Asset Funds. Suitable for medium-term wealth building with controlled volatility.

5) High Risk:
Includes Large Cap Equity Funds, Mid Cap Funds, Aggressive Hybrid Funds, ELSS, Index Funds. Higher volatility but strong long-term returns. Aimed at long-term growth-oriented investors.

6) Very High Risk:
Includes Small Cap Funds, Sectoral/Thematic Funds, International Emerging Market Funds, and Credit Risk Debt Funds. Suitable only for experienced investors seeking high returns and able to tolerate large drawdowns.

Additional Risk Considerations:

• Market Risk – Driven by stock market volatility.  
• Credit Risk – Risk of bond issuer default (high in credit-risk funds).  
• Duration Risk – Sensitivity of debt funds to interest rate movements (high in gilt/long duration funds).  
• Liquidity Risk – Difficulty selling securities during stressed markets.  
• Concentration Risk – Thematic funds carry this due to limited sector exposure.  
• Currency Risk – Present in international FoFs/ETFs.  

Investors must match fund risk levels with:
• Age  
• Goals  
• Time horizon  
• Risk appetite  
• Asset allocation strategy
