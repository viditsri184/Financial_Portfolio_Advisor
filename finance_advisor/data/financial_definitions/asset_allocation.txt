Asset allocation is the process of distributing investments across asset classes such as equity, debt, and gold.
It defines the risk-return characteristics of a portfolio more than individual fund selection.
Strategic allocation aligns with long-term goals, while tactical allocation adjusts to short-term opportunities.
A higher equity allocation increases growth potential but also increases volatility.
Debt allocation provides stability, income, and downside protection.
Gold helps hedge market volatility and acts as a safe-haven asset.
Balanced asset allocation improves consistency and reduces portfolio risk.
Rebalancing is required periodically to maintain target allocation.
Asset allocation must match the investor’s risk profile and time horizon.
Proper allocation is fundamental to successful portfolio management.
