Beta measures how sensitive a fund or stock is to overall market movements.
A beta of 1 means the investment moves in line with the market.
A beta above 1 indicates higher volatility and amplified movement relative to the market.
A beta below 1 suggests more stability and lower sensitivity to market trends.
High-beta stocks suit aggressive investors seeking higher growth potential.
Low-beta stocks suit conservative investors preferring stable returns.
Beta helps estimate systematic risk, which cannot be diversified away.
For mutual funds, beta helps compare volatility with the benchmark index.
Investors should review beta along with standard deviation and Sharpe Ratio for risk evaluation.
Understanding beta is crucial for building portfolios aligned with risk tolerance.
