The expense ratio represents the annual fee that mutual funds charge for managing investor money.
It includes management fees, administrative costs, audit fees, and distribution expenses.
A lower expense ratio generally improves long-term returns due to reduced cost drag.
Actively managed funds often have higher expense ratios than passive index funds.
Regulators like SEBI set limits on maximum allowable expense ratios to protect investors.
Expense ratio is deducted directly from the fund’s NAV on a daily basis.
Even small differences in expense ratio can significantly impact returns over long periods.
Investors should compare expense ratios when selecting similar funds in the same category.
Direct plans offer lower expense ratios than regular plans due to no distributor commissions.
Understanding expense ratio is essential for cost-efficient investing.
