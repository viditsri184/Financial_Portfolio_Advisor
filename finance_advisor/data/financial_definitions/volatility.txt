Volatility measures how much the price of an asset fluctuates within a given time.
High volatility indicates frequent and large price swings, reflecting higher market risk.
It is often expressed as the standard deviation of an asset’s returns.
Volatile assets can offer higher returns but also expose investors to greater downside risk.
Equities, small-cap stocks, and emerging markets typically show higher volatility.
Debt instruments, government bonds, and large-cap stocks show lower volatility.
Volatility helps investors judge the stability and predictability of investment returns.
During uncertain market conditions, volatility tends to spike across asset classes.
Investors with low risk tolerance should choose low-volatility instruments for stability.
Volatility is essential for designing portfolios and running simulations like Monte Carlo.
