Liquidity measures how quickly and easily an asset can be converted into cash without losing value.
Highly liquid assets include savings accounts, liquid funds, and treasury bills.
Illiquid assets include real estate, long-term bonds, and fixed deposits with lock-ins.
Liquidity is essential for handling emergencies and short-term financial needs.
Investors should maintain an emergency fund in highly liquid instruments.
Liquidity risk arises when investors cannot exit or redeem investments when needed.
Funds with exit loads or lock-ins have lower liquidity.
Liquidity also affects pricing — illiquid assets may sell at a discount during stress.
Balancing liquid and illiquid assets is crucial for financial stability.
Proper liquidity planning prevents forced selling during downturns.
