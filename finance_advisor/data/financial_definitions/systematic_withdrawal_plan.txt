A Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP) enables investors to withdraw a fixed amount regularly from their investments.
It is commonly used for monthly income after retirement.
SWPs offer predictable cash flow while keeping the remaining corpus invested.
Withdrawals can be tailored to match living expenses or financial needs.
SWPs help avoid premature full redemption of investments.
Tax efficiency of SWPs often beats traditional savings or pension schemes.
They work best when withdrawals are lower than average fund returns.
SWPs can help manage cash flows during market fluctuations.
They allow control over start date, frequency, and withdrawal amount.
SWPs support long-term wealth preservation along with systematic income.
