CAGR stands for Compound Annual Growth Rate, representing the smoothed annual return of an investment.
It describes how an investment would grow if it increased at a steady rate every year.
CAGR removes the effect of short-term volatility and uneven year-to-year returns.
Investors use it to compare the long-term performance of funds, portfolios, or asset classes.
It is calculated using beginning value, ending value, and the total number of years.
A higher CAGR indicates better long-term compounding and growth potential.
CAGR is ideal for evaluating equity funds, retirement portfolios, and business growth metrics.
However, CAGR does not reflect the risk or volatility experienced during the period.
It should be used along with risk indicators such as Sharpe Ratio or standard deviation.
CAGR is a key metric in financial planning, forecasting, and investment comparison.
