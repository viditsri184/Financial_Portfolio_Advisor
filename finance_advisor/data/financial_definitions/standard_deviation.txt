A high standard deviation indicates larger swings in returns and greater uncertainty.
Low standard deviation signals stability, making assets suitable for risk-averse investors.
This metric is widely used for evaluating equity, debt, and multi-asset funds.
Standard deviation helps differentiate between stable and aggressive fund categories.
It is essential for portfolio optimization and risk management.
Investors should compare standard deviation within the same category for accuracy.
Sharp spikes in standard deviation reflect increased market uncertainty.
Understanding standard deviation helps set expectations for portfolio behavior.
