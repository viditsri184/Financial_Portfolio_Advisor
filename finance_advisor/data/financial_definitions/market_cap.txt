Market capitalization refers to the total market value of a company calculated as share price multiplied by outstanding shares.
It helps classify companies into large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap segments.
Large-cap companies are typically stable industry leaders with lower risk.
Mid-cap and small-cap companies offer higher growth potential but greater volatility.
Market cap helps investors assess company size, stability, and risk characteristics.
Mutual funds often categorize schemes based on market cap allocation guidelines.
Market cap can change due to price movements or corporate actions.
Investors diversify across market caps to balance risk and return.
Large-cap funds are ideal for stability, while small-cap funds suit aggressive investors.
Understanding market cap aids in constructing well-balanced equity portfolios.
