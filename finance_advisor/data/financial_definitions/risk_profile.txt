A risk profile assesses an investor’s willingness and capacity to take financial risks.
It is influenced by factors such as age, income stability, investment experience, and reaction to market losses.
Risk profiles commonly fall into Conservative, Moderate, or Aggressive categories.
Conservative investors prefer safety and stability with lower exposure to equities.
Moderate investors balance growth and stability using hybrid or multi-asset portfolios.
Aggressive investors prioritize high long-term growth and tolerate greater volatility.
Risk profiling helps align portfolio construction with the investor’s emotional and financial tolerance.
It ensures investment strategies remain suitable during market ups and downs.
Risk profiles may change over time with income, age, or financial responsibilities.
Accurate risk profiling is essential for personalized financial planning.
