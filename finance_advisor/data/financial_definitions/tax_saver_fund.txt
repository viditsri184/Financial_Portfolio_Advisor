A tax saver fund, also known as ELSS, is an equity mutual fund that offers tax deductions under Section 80C.
It has a mandatory lock-in period of 3 years, the shortest among tax-saving options.
ELSS funds invest primarily in equities and have potential for high long-term returns.
They are suitable for investors seeking tax benefits along with wealth creation.
Returns are market-linked and may fluctuate in the short term.
Investors should commit to ELSS only if they can tolerate equity volatility.
ELSS performance varies based on fund manager skill and market conditions.
SIP in ELSS helps reduce timing risk and improves long-term outcomes.
Tax efficiency and compounding make ELSS popular for young earners.
ELSS can form part of long-term wealth and retirement plans.
