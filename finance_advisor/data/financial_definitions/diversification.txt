Diversification is an investment strategy that spreads money across different assets to reduce risk.
By holding varied investments, poor performance in one asset can be offset by gains in another.
It balances the risk-return tradeoff and enhances long-term consistency.
Diversification can occur across asset classes, sectors, geographies, or investment styles.
A well-diversified portfolio protects against market shocks and concentration risks.
Equity, debt, gold, and real estate often behave differently across market cycles.
Diversification lowers volatility and improves the probability of stable returns.
Over-diversification, however, can dilute returns without significantly reducing risk.
Modern portfolio theory emphasizes diversification using correlation among assets.
Proper diversification is fundamental for building optimal portfolios for any risk profile.
