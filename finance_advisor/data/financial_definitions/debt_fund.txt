A debt fund invests in fixed-income instruments such as government bonds, corporate bonds, treasury bills, and money market securities.
These funds aim to provide stable and predictable returns with lower volatility compared to equity funds.
Debt funds come in categories such as liquid funds, corporate bond funds, gilt funds, short-duration funds, and dynamic funds.
Returns depend on interest rate movements, credit quality, and maturity profile of underlying securities.
Debt funds suit conservative investors or those seeking capital preservation and steady income.
Interest rate cycles can cause short-term fluctuations in debt fund performance.
Higher credit-rated bonds generally offer lower returns but come with lower risk.
Debt funds are commonly used for emergency funds, medium-term goals, and rebalancing portfolios.
Investors should consider portfolio duration, credit risk, and yield-to-maturity before investing.
Debt funds offer better tax efficiency than fixed deposits if held for the long term.
