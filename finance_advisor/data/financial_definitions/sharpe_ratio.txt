The Sharpe Ratio measures how much excess return an investment generates per unit of risk.
It is calculated as (Portfolio Return − Risk-free Rate) divided by the portfolio’s volatility.
A higher Sharpe Ratio indicates better risk-adjusted performance.
It helps investors compare investments with different volatility levels.
Sharpe Ratio is widely used in portfolio optimization and fund comparison.
It penalizes portfolios with higher volatility, even if returns are high.
Sharpe works best when return distributions are roughly normal and stable.
Limitations include sensitivity to historical data and return assumptions.
Investors should not rely solely on Sharpe; use alongside Sortino and maximum drawdown.
Sharpe Ratio remains a foundational measure for risk-aware investing.
