Alpha measures the excess return of an investment relative to its benchmark index.
A positive alpha indicates outperformance, while a negative alpha shows underperformance.
Fund managers with high alpha are considered skilled at selecting winning investments.
Alpha reflects not only returns but also the level of risk taken.
In mutual funds, alpha helps assess whether active management added value.
However, alpha can vary across market conditions and time periods.
Investors should analyze long-term alpha trends rather than short-term spikes.
Alpha should be compared within the same fund category for meaningful insights.
It is often used alongside beta, Sharpe Ratio, and standard deviation.
Alpha is a core metric in evaluating fund manager performance.
