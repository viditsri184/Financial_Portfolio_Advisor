NAV stands for Net Asset Value, representing the per-unit price of a mutual fund scheme.
It is computed as (Total Assets − Liabilities) divided by the number of outstanding units.
NAV is updated daily based on the closing market value of the fund's holdings.
A higher or lower NAV does not indicate whether a fund is good or bad—performance matters.
NAV is the price at which investors buy or redeem mutual fund units.
In open-ended funds, NAV changes daily with market fluctuations.
For ETFs, NAV helps determine fair value compared to market traded price.
Investors should focus on long-term returns rather than short-term NAV movements.
NAV-based comparison is useful for understanding growth from the time of investment.
Understanding NAV is key to learning how mutual funds are valued and transacted.
