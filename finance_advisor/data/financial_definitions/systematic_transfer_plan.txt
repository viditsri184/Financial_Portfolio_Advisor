A Systematic Transfer Plan (STP) allows investors to move a fixed amount from one mutual fund to another at regular intervals.
It is commonly used to transfer funds from debt to equity or vice versa based on market conditions.
STPs help reduce timing risk when shifting lump-sum money into equity funds.
They provide smoother market entry and reduce the impact of volatility.
Investors use STPs for goal-based planning, such as gradually increasing equity exposure.
STPs can also help shift assets to safer categories as goals approach maturity.
STPs are flexible in frequency, amount, and duration.
Some AMCs offer intelligent STPs linked to market indicators.
They are ideal for deploying large lump sums into volatile asset classes.
STPs blend safety, structure, and market participation effectively.
